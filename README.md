# CC-attack ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Version-2.9-brightgreen.svg) ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)
 A script for using socks4/5 proxies to attack http server.
 
 I removed the mixed proxies flood because in my perspective, it doesn't give more performance when flooding.

## Sth need to talk

I made a golang httpflood with socks5, its powerful when added random url, header

and with some js resovler. I used it to take down some gov website and for some reason

I decided to release it's base.

The release will not have any function, just send simple http request through socks5 with socket
